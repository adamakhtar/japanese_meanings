Better Japanese Support Plugin

I wrote this plugin because I saw that it is possible to enchance the Japanese Support Plugin by automatically adding the meanings to the fields aswell. Japanese Support is not required for this plugin to work. Having installed both worked fine for me too although it is unclear which reading will be used.

To get the meanings I use the same database as the awesome Yomichan plugin, which itself uses Rikaichan to make it easy to read books using Anki.

Yomichan does not need to be installed though

Install:

1. Download this plugin using Anki
2. Crate a Note type having 'Japanese' in its name/
3. Make that Note type have the fields 'Expression', 'Reading' and 'Meaning'
4. Fill the expression field, as soon as you click somewhere else or tab out of it it should fill the meaning.

I am not super familiar with QT so if you want to change the desired field names or change which card types should be considered open up the plugin code and change the names. I don't know how to make a proper menu.
(should be located in Documents/Anki/addons/better_japanese_support/main.py)

So far this plugin has only been testen on OSX but if Yomichan works for you this plugin should work too.

Hope you enjoy!
